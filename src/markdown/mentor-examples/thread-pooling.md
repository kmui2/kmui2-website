### 12. **Thread Pooling**

**Junior Dev**: "I’ve got multiple requests hitting our trading service, but sometimes it seems overwhelmed. How can I handle multiple requests better?"

**You**: "You can use thread pooling. Imagine you’re at a restaurant and there are only a limited number of waiters. When too many customers arrive, the waiters get overwhelmed. A thread pool ensures you only have a fixed number of threads (or waiters) handling tasks at once."

**Junior Dev**: "How do I implement thread pooling in Java?"

**You**: "You can use `ExecutorService` to create a thread pool. Here’s an example where we process trade orders using a pool of 10 threads:"

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class TradeProcessor {
    private static final ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); // Pool of 10 threads

    public void processTrade(String tradeOrder) {
        executorService.submit(() -> {
            // Simulate processing the trade order
            System.out.println("Processing trade: " + tradeOrder);
        });
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        executorService.shutdown(); // Shutdown the thread pool after use
    }
}
```

**Junior Dev**: "So we can handle up to 10 trade orders concurrently?"

**You**: "Exactly, the thread pool will manage up to 10 concurrent tasks. If there are more requests, they’ll wait in line until a thread becomes available—just like how customers wait until a waiter is free."
