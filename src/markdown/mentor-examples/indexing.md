### 1. **Database Indexing**

**Junior Dev**: "The queries in our database are running slow. I’m not sure why."

**You**: "Have you checked if the necessary indexes are in place? Indexing can significantly speed up query performance, especially on large tables."

**Junior Dev**: "I know about primary keys, but I’m not sure what other indexes to add."

**You**: "Think of indexes like looking up a contact on your phone. Without a search function, you’d have to scroll through all your contacts to find the one you want. Similarly, without indexes, the database has to scan every row, which slows things down. In Java, if you're using Hibernate with JPA, you can add indexes at the entity level like this:"

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "trades", indexes = {
    @Index(name = "idx_trade_date", columnList = "tradeDate")
})
public class Trade {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "tradeDate")
    private LocalDate tradeDate;
    // other fields, getters, and setters
}
```

**Junior Dev**: "That looks helpful! So this creates an index on the `tradeDate` field in the `trades` table?"

**You**: "Exactly. Now queries using the `tradeDate` field in a `WHERE` clause will perform much faster—just like how a search function helps you quickly find a contact."
