### 15. **Load Testing**

**Junior Dev**: "We’re expecting a lot of users during a big stock trading event. How do we ensure our service can handle the load?"

**You**: "You should conduct load testing. It’s like stress-testing a bridge to see how much weight it can carry before it breaks. You need to simulate a large number of users hitting your service at the same time to see how it performs."

**Junior Dev**: "How do I perform load testing?"

**You**: "You can use tools like **Apache JMeter** or **Gatling** for load testing. Here’s an example of setting up a JMeter test to simulate 100 users placing trades simultaneously:"

1. Open JMeter and create a new **Thread Group**.
2. Set the **Number of Threads (users)** to 100.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** sampler with the trading API URL (e.g., `/api/trade`).
4. Set the **Loop Count** to 1 for each user to make one trade.
5. Run the test to see how the system handles 100 simultaneous trade requests.

**Junior Dev**: "This will help us identify potential bottlenecks in the system?"

**You**: "Exactly. It’ll show you how your trading system behaves under heavy load, helping you tune performance before the actual event—like checking the strength of a bridge before letting thousands of cars drive across."
