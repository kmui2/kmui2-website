### 6. **Kubernetes Networking with Kustomization**

**Junior Dev**: "I’ve got multiple services running on Kubernetes, but they can’t seem to communicate with each other. What’s going wrong?"

**You**: "It’s probably a networking issue. In Kubernetes, each pod gets its own IP address, but they still need to be able to talk to each other within the cluster. It’s like having a group of people in different rooms at a large building—they each have a phone, but they need a phone line to connect."

**Junior Dev**: "How do I set up networking and manage it with Kustomization?"

**You**: "You can configure Kubernetes services to ensure that pods can communicate with each other through their service names. You can also use Kustomize to manage different environments, making networking and deployment configurations easier to handle."

**Junior Dev**: "How does Kustomize help?"

**You**: "Kustomize allows you to create reusable base configurations and overlay them for different environments. It’s like having a master plan for wiring the phones in the building, and then creating custom wiring for each floor."

Here’s how you could set up Kubernetes services with networking using Kustomization:

1. **Create your base deployment** for the trade processor services:

```yaml
# base/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: trade-processor
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: trade-processor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: trade-processor
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: trade-processor
          image: trade-processor:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

2. **Create a service** to expose the trade processor pods:

```yaml
# base/service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: trade-processor
spec:
  selector:
    app: trade-processor
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

3. **Set up a kustomization file** to group these resources:

```yaml
# base/kustomization.yaml
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
```

4. **Create an overlay** for a specific environment (like staging or production):

```yaml
# overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml
namespace: staging
resources:
  - ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - replica-count.yaml

# overlays/staging/replica-count.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: trade-processor
spec:
  replicas: 3
```

5. **Apply the overlay** using Kustomize:

```sh
kubectl apply -k overlays/staging
```

**Junior Dev**: "So Kustomize lets me reuse the base configuration and apply environment-specific changes, like increasing the number of replicas?"

**You**: "Exactly! And Kubernetes ensures that all your services can communicate within the cluster using their service names. In this example, the `trade-processor` service acts as a phone line, connecting pods to each other just by calling the service name."
