### **Category: Kafka - Real-Time Market Data Consumption**

**Product Owner**: "We’re struggling to keep up with market data during peak times, and our real-time pricing is delayed. What can we do to process data more quickly?"

**You**: "Right now, the way we process market data is like trying to catch every drop from a waterfall with a single bucket—it just can’t handle the volume when the data spikes. By using Kafka, we can build a distributed data pipeline to manage the bursts more efficiently."

**Product Owner**: "How will Kafka help with this?"

**You**: "Kafka acts like a reservoir, capturing and buffering the incoming market data in real time. This lets us consume the data at a controlled rate. I’ve measured the data ingestion rate by monitoring Kafka’s consumer lag and tracking how fast messages are being processed. By implementing Kafka, we should be able to reduce data latency by 30%, ensuring more timely pricing for our users."
