At CME Group, I was tasked with optimizing the performance of our real-time risk management application, which relied on Redis for caching financial data. As traffic increased, we noticed slower response times. I began tracking key Redis metrics using Redis’s monitoring tools and GCP’s Stackdriver, focusing on cache hit ratio, latency per operation, and memory usage. Our cache hit ratio was only around 65%, causing more database hits than necessary, and some requests were experiencing up to 300 milliseconds of latency, well above our 100-millisecond target. Additionally, memory usage was spiking due to inefficient data eviction.

To improve performance, I adjusted the TTL (time-to-live) settings to retain frequently accessed data longer, which increased the cache hit ratio from 65% to 85%. I also optimized the eviction policy to use the least-recently-used (LRU) strategy, which stabilized memory usage. As a result, the latency dropped from 300 milliseconds to under 90 milliseconds, and the changes led to a 20% reduction in database load. I presented these improvements to the team, showing how the adjustments significantly enhanced system performance and user experience.

### **Category: Redis - Caching for Market Data Lookups**

**Product Owner**: "Our market data lookups are too slow, especially when users are trying to see the latest stock prices. How can we improve this?"

**You**: "Fetching market data directly from the database each time is like waiting in line for every order at a busy restaurant. By caching frequently accessed data in Redis, we can serve the data much faster."

**Product Owner**: "What kind of improvement should we expect?"

**You**: "We can reduce lookup times by about 60%. I measured the cache hit ratio using Redis’ built-in monitoring tools (`INFO command`), and by caching the most frequently queried stock prices, we can reduce the load on the database and drastically improve response times for our users."

### **Category: Redis - Session Management for User Authentication**

**Manager**: "We’re noticing slow login times when too many users are authenticating at once. How can we make the login process more efficient?"

**You**: "It’s like trying to get through airport security during rush hour—too many people, and the process gets bogged down. We can implement Redis as a session store to handle user authentication faster."

**Manager**: "What improvement do you expect?"

**You**: "By using Redis for session management and caching authentication tokens, we can reduce the time it takes to authenticate users. I measured the impact using **Redis’s INFO command** and monitored login times via **Google Cloud Monitoring**. We achieved a 40% reduction in login times, significantly improving the user experience during peak hours."
