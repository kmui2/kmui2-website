### **Category: Spark - Streaming for Risk Model Optimization**

**Product Owner**: "Our risk models take too long to adjust after receiving new market data, leading to outdated assessments. How can we speed this up?"

**You**: "Right now, we’re processing large datasets in batches, which creates delays. It’s like trying to make sense of a puzzle by looking at all the pieces at once. By using Apache Spark Streaming, we can process the data incrementally, updating risk models as new data flows in."

**Product Owner**: "How will Spark improve our performance?"

**You**: "With Spark Streaming, we can reduce the risk model update time by about 20% based on the metrics we tracked—specifically using Spark’s job monitoring tools to track throughput and latency. This means risk models will be more up-to-date, improving the accuracy of our assessments in fast-moving markets."
