### **Category: Google Cloud Dashboards - Visualizing Trading Metrics**

**Product Owner**: "Our clients want more transparency into trading performance, but we don’t have an easy way to show how our system is performing. How can we provide real-time metrics?"

**You**: "It’s like driving blindfolded—you can’t make decisions without seeing where you’re going. By setting up Google Cloud Dashboards dashboards, we can visualize key trading metrics in real time, like execution times, success rates, and latency."

**Product Owner**: "What kind of metrics will this track?"

**You**: "I’ve integrated **Google Cloud Dashboards** with Google Cloud Monitoring to track trading service metrics such as order execution time, failed trades, and market data ingestion. With these visualizations, we can easily show performance improvements, and clients will have better insight into our system. For example, we’ve already seen a 15% improvement in execution times after optimizing our database queries."
