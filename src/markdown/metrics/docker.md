### **Category: Docker - Optimizing Container Performance for Risk Calculations**

**Product Owner**: "Our containers running the risk calculation service are consuming too much memory, causing instability during volatile markets. Can we make them more efficient?"

**You**: "Right now, each container is like an overstuffed suitcase—there’s too much inside, and it’s making it harder to manage. We need to optimize the memory usage by reducing the container footprint and fine-tuning resource limits."

**Product Owner**: "How will this help?"

**You**: "By slimming down our Docker images and setting proper CPU and memory limits, we can reduce resource consumption. I tracked this using **Docker Stats** and found a 25% reduction in memory usage per container. This allows us to run more containers simultaneously, improving overall system stability during high-load periods."
