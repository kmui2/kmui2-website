### **Category: Google Cloud Monitoring - Monitoring Risk Analysis Metrics**

**Manager**: "We need better visibility into how our risk analysis jobs are performing. Right now, we don’t have enough data to track how efficient they are."

**You**: "It’s like driving a car without a speedometer—there’s no way to know how fast or slow you’re going. By integrating Google Cloud Monitoring, we can track detailed metrics on job performance, resource usage, and bottlenecks."

**Manager**: "How do we start monitoring this?"

**You**: "I’ve set up **Google Cloud Monitoring** to scrape metrics from our risk analysis services, including job completion times and CPU/memory usage. We can visualize this data in **Google Cloud Dashboards**. With this, we identified that some jobs were taking 40% longer due to CPU contention, and we’re working on rebalancing those workloads."
