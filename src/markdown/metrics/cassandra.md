### **Category: Cassandra - Optimizing Data Writes for Market Prices**

**Manager**: "We’re struggling with slow writes to our database for real-time market prices. This is delaying updates for our clients. How can we improve this?"

**You**: "The problem is that Cassandra is getting overwhelmed with write requests, which is like trying to fill too many water bottles at once with a single faucet. By tuning Cassandra's write throughput and configuring batch writes, we can spread the load more effectively."

**Manager**: "What results can we expect from this?"

**You**: "I optimized the **replication factor** and write consistency levels in Cassandra. Using **nodetool** to measure the write latency, we’ve reduced write times by 20%, ensuring market prices are updated faster for clients. This also improves our overall SLA for market data."
