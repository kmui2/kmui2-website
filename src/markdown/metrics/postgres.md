### **Category: Postgres - Database Optimization for Trade Execution**

**Manager**: "Trade execution time has been slowing down, especially as our trading database grows. How can we improve this?"

**You**: "The issue lies in our database’s query performance as it handles larger datasets. It’s like using a library without an index—you’re wasting time scanning through everything to find what you need. We can optimize our Postgres database by adding appropriate indexes to speed up lookups for trade data."

**Manager**: "What impact will that have?"

**You**: "I’ve already tested this by adding indexes on the trade timestamps and stock symbols. I measured query performance before and after using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in Postgres, and we can reduce the query time by 40%, bringing our trade execution time back within acceptable limits."
