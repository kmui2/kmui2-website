### 1. Challenging Project:

- Led migration of 5+ Java microservices to GCP at CME Group.
- Collaboration with infrastructure teams.
- Optimized pipeline throughput by 20% using multi-threading and distributed caching.

### 2. Performance Optimization:

- Increased CME data pipeline throughput by 20% with multi-threading and caching.
- Used downtime metric in meeting SLA times and daily job alerts.

### 1. Scalability:

- Optimized high-volume risk management apps at CME for scalability by leveraging multi-threading and distributed database caching.
- Designed microservices to handle increasing data loads efficiently with minimal performance degradation.

### 2. Distributed Databases (Cassandra):

- Used Cassandra at CME to implement distributed database caching, improving read/write performance.
- Ensured fault tolerance and scalability by distributing data across nodes, allowing for horizontal scaling.

### 3. Regional Failover:

- Implemented failover strategies across multiple regional zones at CME, reducing on-call incidents by 30%.
- Ensured high availability by setting up active-passive and active-active failover configurations for critical services.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (Helm Charts):

- Adopted Helm Charts for managing Kubernetes deployments at CME, enabling consistent and automated infrastructure rollouts.
- Reduced deployment errors and manual interventions by automating the creation and configuration of cloud infrastructure.

### 5. Database Sharding Using Historical Dates:

- Implemented database sharding strategies based on historical date ranges to improve query performance and manage data growth.
- Used sharding techniques to divide large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks, improving access times for time-series data.

### 3. Code Quality:

- Introduced end-to-end testing at CME, reducing bugs by 40%.
- Emphasize automated testing, code reviews, and use of monitoring tools (Splunk, Argo).

### 4. Cloud Technologies:

- Extensive experience with GCP, AWS, and Azure.
- Led CME’s microservice migration to GCP, leveraging Docker/Kubernetes for deployment and optimization.

### 5. Microservices:

- Developed Java microservices for CME’s high-volume risk management applications.
- Optimized services with concurrency strategies and distributed caching.

### 6. Managing Large-Scale Systems:

- Implemented failover strategies across regional zones at CME, reducing incidents by 30%.
- Used load balancing and multi-threaded architecture to handle high data volumes.

### 8. Automation & CI/CD:

- Adopted Infrastructure as Code at CME, increasing deployment frequency from quarterly to weekly.
- Automated end-to-end testing and integrated CI/CD pipelines with cloud platforms.

### 9. Team Collaboration:

- Practiced Agile/Scrum at CME, working with cross-functional teams.
- Integrated AI features with front-end/back-end teams at DataChat.
