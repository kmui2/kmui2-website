When explaining technical challenges to stakeholders without a technical background, I focus on simplifying complex concepts without sacrificing clarity. I start by framing the issue in terms of the business impact or goals they care about, using analogies or real-world examples to help them relate to the challenge.

For instance, if there’s a delay due to a system performance issue, instead of talking about threads or memory leaks, I might explain it like this: ‘Our system is currently handling more data than it was originally designed for, which is slowing down processing times. Think of it like a highway at rush hour—there’s more traffic than the road can handle, so we’re working on adding extra lanes to make it flow smoothly again.’

I also keep the conversation solution-oriented, focusing on the steps we’re taking to resolve the issue and providing an estimated timeline. This helps stakeholders feel informed and reassured without being overwhelmed by technical jargon.

**Scenario with a Product Owner:**

**Product Owner**: "Can you explain the technical risks to the business team?"

**You**: "Sure, I’ll explain it like home renovations. We can either take the time to inspect the structure and fix small cracks now, or rush through and risk the foundation weakening later."
