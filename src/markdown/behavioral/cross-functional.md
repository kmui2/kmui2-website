One project that stands out where I collaborated with cross-functional teams was the launch of a new risk model at CME Group, which involved working closely with not only the development team but also product managers, the QA team, and cloud engineers as part of our migration to Google Cloud. Given the complexity of the project, it was crucial that all teams stayed aligned.

To ensure alignment, I implemented regular cross-functional team meetings where we reviewed progress, identified potential bottlenecks, and made sure everyone understood how their part fit into the bigger picture. I also set up dedicated chat groups for real-time communication, allowing for quick resolution of issues. Additionally, I maintained clear documentation, including system architecture and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), so that every team had access to up-to-date information.

By keeping communication open and making sure everyone had clear visibility into the project’s status, we were able to successfully launch the risk model on time. It was a true team effort, and ensuring alignment across departments was a key factor in the project’s success.

**QA**: "We’re still testing, but the dev team is ready to move ahead."

**You**: "It’s like two sides building a bridge from opposite ends. We need to meet in the middle, so we’ll coordinate better to ensure testing aligns with the development timeline."
