I determine a project’s success by evaluating several key factors. First and foremost, the project needs to meet its defined objectives and deliverables—whether it’s improving system performance, launching a new feature, or migrating to the cloud—within the given timeline and budget. I also consider how well the project addresses the needs of stakeholders and end-users, as their satisfaction is critical to long-term success.

Another important aspect is the quality of the solution, ensuring it’s scalable, maintainable, and aligned with best practices. I also look at team collaboration—successful projects are often the result of effective teamwork and clear communication. Lastly, post-launch performance is crucial, so I measure success by monitoring key metrics, ensuring the solution is stable, and handling any issues that arise smoothly. A truly successful project not only delivers immediate value but also sets the stage for future growth.

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "How do you define success for this project?"

**You**: "I think of it like a well-executed relay race—each phase needs to be passed smoothly to the next, and we finish strong by meeting our goals without dropping the baton along the way."
