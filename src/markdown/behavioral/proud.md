One of the accomplishments I’m most proud of was our successful launch of a new risk model at CME, which coincided with our migration to GCP. It was a complex and high-impact project, and the fact that we were able to deliver it smoothly while managing the cloud transition was a huge win for the team. We celebrated this milestone twice in the same year—once when we hit our initial release deadline, and again when we saw the results of its impact on performance and stability. As part of the celebration, I made homemade egg tarts for the team in our potluck, which became a fun tradition and brought everyone together!

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "What’s a project you’re proud of?"

**You**: "I’m proud of the time we optimized our risk management system. It was like solving a complex puzzle, with each optimization improving the overall efficiency. Seeing the final result come together was incredibly satisfying."
