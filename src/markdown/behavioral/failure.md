“There was a time during a project at CME Group where we were migrating a critical risk management service to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The migration was aimed at improving scalability and reducing costs, and I was responsible for leading the team and ensuring the service was fully operational before a hard deadline, set by our internal clearing house, due to upcoming regulatory requirements.

Everything was progressing well, but during the final integration phase, we encountered unexpected issues with the IAM configurations and load balancing in GCP. These issues hadn’t surfaced in staging but caused failures in production. I underestimated the complexities of replicating the on-prem infrastructure in GCP. We tried to troubleshoot quickly, but it became clear we wouldn’t meet the deadline.

Ultimately, we missed the deadline by a few days, which was frustrating for the clearing house and impacted their operations temporarily. I took full responsibility for the delay and immediately worked with the team to resolve the issues and improve our testing environments.

From this, I learned the importance of implementing more production-like testing environments earlier in the cycle, and this experience led me to introduce better testing frameworks for future migrations. It was a challenging situation, but it ultimately helped improve our processes and reduced future downtime.”

Dialog with Manager:

Manager: “Missing that deadline with the clearing house was tough. What do you think went wrong?”

You: “I think of it like planning a big road trip, but only test-driving the car in the neighborhood. Everything seemed fine, but once we hit the highway—production, in this case—the engine started overheating because we hadn’t properly tested it at full speed. W
