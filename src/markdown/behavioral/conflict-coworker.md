While leading the migration of several on-prem Java microservices to GCP at CME Group, I encountered a conflict with a fellow engineer over priorities during the launch of a critical risk management service. Our goal was to ensure a smooth rollout while maintaining automated end-to-end testing, which I had advocated for to reduce production bugs. However, my colleague was focused on meeting our aggressive launch deadline and suggested cutting automated testing, arguing that manual testing would be sufficient given the time constraints.

I believed skipping automated tests was too risky, as manual testing had missed critical edge cases in the past. To address the situation, I used an analogy from multiplayer strategy games like League of Legends. In those games, teamwork and coordination are crucial—you can’t focus solely on offense (launching the product) without defending your base (automated testing). I explained that automated testing was our defense, protecting us from potential bugs post-launch.

This approach helped shift the conversation from a “deadline vs. quality” debate to a broader strategy. I offered to lead the automation efforts myself, balancing both testing and the launch schedule. The product launched successfully, with a 40% reduction in production bugs, highlighting the importance of balancing short-term goals with long-term stability.

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "I heard there was some tension with another engineer over the architecture decision."

**You**: "Yes, but we resolved it. It was like two drivers meeting at a crossroads. We both wanted to take different routes, but by discussing our goals, we found a middle path that worked for both."
