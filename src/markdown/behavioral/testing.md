I believe software testing is a critical aspect of the development lifecycle that ensures the quality, reliability, and performance of the product. In my experience, well-structured testing strategies help catch issues early, reduce bugs in production, and lead to more maintainable and scalable systems.

I advocate for a balanced approach that includes unit testing to validate individual components, integration testing to ensure that different modules work well together, and end-to-end testing to simulate real-world usage. Automated testing is also a key part of maintaining efficiency, especially in continuous integration and deployment pipelines. At CME, for instance, I implemented end-to-end testing for our microservices, which significantly reduced production bugs and improved release confidence.

In my view, testing not only helps ensure that the code works as expected but also serves as documentation for the systemâ€™s behavior. It gives teams the confidence to move quickly while maintaining stability, which is essential in fast-paced development environments.

**Scenario with QA:**

**QA**: "How do you view the importance of testing in our workflow?"

**You**: "Testing is like building a safety net under a trapeze. It ensures that even if something goes wrong during development, we can catch issues before they impact the end users. The better the net, the safer the project."
