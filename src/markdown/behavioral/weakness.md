One area my team might mention as a weakness is that I can sometimes focus too much on details during code reviews, especially when it comes to architectural performance and testing strategies. While my attention to detail helps maintain high standards, I’ve realized that I need to balance this with keeping the bigger picture in mind to avoid slowing down progress. I’m working on improving by prioritizing feedback that directly impacts functionality and timelines.

Additionally, I’ve learned that I occasionally expect others to approach coding and problem-solving the same way I do. Over time, I’ve recognized that different people have diverse coding styles and thought processes, which can lead to innovative solutions. I’m focusing on becoming more adaptable by valuing these different approaches and understanding that there are often multiple ways to achieve a great outcome.

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "What would you say is one of your weaknesses?"

**You**: "One of my weaknesses is that I can get too focused on perfecting the details. It’s like polishing a gem—sometimes I spend too much time refining something that’s already good. I’m working on balancing that with the need to deliver on time."
