In my team at CME Group, our pull request (PR) process starts once a developer completes a feature or bug fix. They create a PR in our Git repository, providing a detailed description of the changes, linking the relevant Jira ticket, and including any necessary documentation. We emphasize clear PR descriptions so reviewers can easily understand the purpose and context of the code.

Before the PR can be reviewed, it must pass through automated testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and static code analysis. After the tests pass, the PR moves to the review stage, where it requires approval from at least two team members. Reviewers focus on both the functionality and code quality, offering feedback or requesting changes if needed. Once the PR receives the two necessary approvals and all feedback is addressed, it can be merged into the main branch, ensuring the code is thoroughly vetted before going into production.

**Scenario with a Dev Team Member:**

**Dev**: "How do you handle pull request reviews?"

**You**: "I treat pull requests like quality control in a factory. Each review ensures that the product moving forward is free of defects and up to standard. I focus on providing constructive feedback while balancing the need to keep things moving efficiently."
