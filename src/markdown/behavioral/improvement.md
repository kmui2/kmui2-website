At CME Group, I noticed that our end-to-end testing process was largely manual and time-consuming, which delayed our releases. I suggested automating the end-to-end testing process using Argo CD workflows and containers, instead of the traditional Jenkins and Terraform setup.

I explained to the team how leveraging Argo CD’s declarative GitOps model could streamline our testing pipeline by automating the execution of tests across multiple environments and making the process more reliable. I led the initiative, setting up a system where tests were automatically triggered with each change, ensuring continuous and thorough validation.

As a result, we saw a significant reduction in the time spent on manual testing and an increase in test coverage. The automated testing pipeline not only improved our deployment quality but also allowed us to identify bugs earlier in the process, reducing production issues by 40%. This approach became a critical part of our testing strategy moving forward.

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "What’s one area where you’ve focused on improvement?"

**You**: "I’ve been improving my efficiency in code reviews. It’s like sharpening a tool—I’ve honed my ability to give more concise feedback, which makes the entire process faster."
