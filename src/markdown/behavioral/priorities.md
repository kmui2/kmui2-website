At CME Group, I managed three major priorities: launching a new risk model, migrating services to GCP, and ensuring automated testing was integrated to maintain quality. To handle this, I first focused on stabilizing the risk model’s core functionality since it had the highest impact, then tackled the GCP migration to optimize performance and scalability. Automated testing was integrated throughout both processes to catch potential issues early. For example, I prioritized testing critical risk model calculations before fully committing to the GCP migration, which prevented potential delays. By organizing and balancing these priorities, we successfully launched the risk model, completed the migration on time, and reduced production bugs by 40% through automated testing.

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "How do you handle shifting priorities?"

**You**: "It’s like playing chess. You always have to be thinking a few steps ahead and ready to adapt when the situation changes, making sure the next move still gets you closer to the goal."
