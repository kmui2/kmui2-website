I’ve spent five years at CME and have gained a wealth of experience, particularly in developing high-volume risk management systems and leading cloud migration projects. Now, I feel it’s the right time to take on new challenges and leverage the skills I’ve developed in a fresh environment where I can continue to grow and contribute to impactful projects.

**You**: "I see it like completing a chapter in a book. I’ve learned a lot here, but I’m looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow in the next chapter of my career."
