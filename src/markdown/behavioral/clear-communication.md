Clear communication played a crucial role during the migration of key risk management services to Google Cloud at CME Group. The project involved multiple teams, including development, operations, and product management, and we had a tight deadline to avoid impacting live trading systems.

To ensure alignment, I set up regular cross-functional meetings and implemented clear channels for real-time communication, such as dedicated chat groups and status dashboards. I also made sure to keep stakeholders updated with concise, transparent reports on progress, risks, and any potential delays. One key instance where clear communication made a difference was when we identified a performance bottleneck during testing. By quickly communicating the issue and collaborating with the cloud and architecture teams, we were able to resolve it before it impacted the production timeline.

As a result, we completed the migration smoothly, on time, with no disruptions. The clarity and consistency of communication helped us anticipate and address issues early, keeping the project on track.

**Scenario with a Dev Team Member:**

**Dev**: "I didn’t realize you needed those API specs so soon. I thought we had more time."

**You**: "It’s like playing a team sport. Without clear communication, we can’t pass the ball effectively. Let’s make sure we’re aligned on timelines moving forward."
