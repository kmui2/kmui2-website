For example, during a project at CME Group where we were migrating Java microservices to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I worked closely with the product owner to prioritize the services based on business impact. We had a tight deadline, so I communicated regularly about the technical complexities of each service migration. This helped the product owner adjust priorities, focusing on high-impact services first while allowing the team enough time to handle the more complex migrations without rushing.

In another instance, while implementing a new risk model that involved integrating APIs for real-time market data, the product owner initially wanted certain data displayed on the dashboard in a specific format. After evaluating the technical feasibility, I realized that formatting the data in that way would add significant complexity and time to the project. I discussed alternative solutions with the product owner, showing how we could deliver the same functionality in a more efficient manner. We agreed on a solution that met the business needs without compromising on the timeline, demonstrating how our close collaboration allowed us to balance technical and business priorities effectively.

**Scenario with a Product Owner:**

**Product Owner**: "How do you collaborate with the product team?"

**You**: "I see our collaboration like working with a blueprint. You give the vision and structure, and I focus on making sure the building blocks fit perfectly to bring it to life."
