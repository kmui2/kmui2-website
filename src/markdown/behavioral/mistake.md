At CME Group, while working on a critical pricing service, I accidentally misconfigured one of our microservices to connect to the wrong environment. This mistake wasn’t caught immediately because the service passed local tests, but once it hit the staging environment, everything started failing. With a major demo approaching, I realized the severity of the issue and knew it had to be fixed quickly.

I immediately took responsibility, informed the team, and dove into troubleshooting. After isolating the issue, I corrected the environment variables and ran additional tests to ensure no other systems were impacted. Fortunately, our end-to-end tests caught the error before it went live, preventing a larger issue.

To prevent this from happening again, we implemented a validation step in our deployment pipeline to flag misconfigurations early. This experience taught me the importance of automated safeguards and taking ownership when mistakes occur. It also strengthened our team’s camaraderie, especially when I lightened the mood with my analogy about bringing a spoon to a sword fight.

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "Can you tell me about a time you made a mistake?"

**You**: "It was like taking a wrong turn on a road trip. I missed a key detail during deployment, but I quickly backtracked, fixed the issue, and got us back on the right path before it impacted production."
