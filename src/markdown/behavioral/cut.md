Yes, I’ve had to make trade-offs to meet tight deadlines. One example was during the launch of a new risk model at CME Group. We were under pressure to deliver on time, but we realized that implementing some advanced analytics, such as real-time scenario analysis and stress testing, would delay the release.

To decide what to cut, I worked closely with stakeholders to evaluate the impact of each feature on the core functionality. We determined that the core risk calculations were the top priority, while the advanced analytics could be postponed to a future iteration without affecting the model’s main purpose. By focusing on delivering the essential risk calculations first, we were able to meet the deadline, and the advanced analytics features were successfully implemented in a later release. This allowed us to deliver a functioning product on time while leaving room for future enhancements.

**Scenario with a Product Owner:**

**Product Owner**: "We need to cut some features to meet the release deadline."

**You**: "It’s like packing for a long trip. We need to decide what’s essential and leave behind what can be added later without impacting the journey."
