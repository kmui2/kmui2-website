After receiving feedback from my manager about improving cross-functional communication, I took the initiative to implement chat groups for different teams, organize regular release meetings, and create clear documentation on SOPs and system architecture. These steps significantly enhanced collaboration, ensured that everyone was aligned, and reduced the chances of miscommunication. The new communication structure became a key factor in streamlining our workflows and preventing delays.

My manager once gave me feedback that I was being too meticulous in my pull request reviews, often focusing on minor stylistic details rather than the bigger picture. I took this feedback seriously and adjusted my approach. I started prioritizing key areas like functionality, performance, and code quality, while being more flexible on minor stylistic differences. This shift not only made the review process more efficient but also helped foster a more collaborative and positive atmosphere within the team. It was a great learning experience on how to focus on what truly adds value to the project.”

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "How do you handle feedback?"

**You**: "I see feedback like a coach’s advice during training. It’s essential to improve, even if it stings a bit. I always take it as an opportunity to get better."
