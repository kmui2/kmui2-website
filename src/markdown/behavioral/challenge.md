One of the biggest challenges I faced was during the simultaneous launch of our new risk model while we were migrating several core services to GCP. The complexity of managing both projects at the same time, without disrupting critical operations, required intense coordination across multiple teams. We were dealing with tight deadlines, and there was significant pressure to ensure everything worked seamlessly post-migration.

To handle this, I took the lead in organizing daily stand-ups with cross-functional teams to track progress, identify blockers, and ensure clear communication. I also implemented regular release meetings and created thorough documentation on our deployment processes and architecture, which helped keep everyone aligned. By proactively managing these elements, we not only launched on time but also saw improved system performance. The success of the project was celebrated twice that year, and it became a highlight of my career.

**Scenario with a Dev Team Member:**

**Dev**: "This new integration seems difficult with the timelines we have."

**You**: "It’s like scaling a steep rock wall. Each step might seem tough, but with careful planning and effort, we’ll eventually make it to the top. Let's break it down into manageable steps."
