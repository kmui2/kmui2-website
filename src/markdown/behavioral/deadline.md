“There was a situation where I failed to meet a deadline for the internal clearing house at CME Group. We were rolling out an important update to our risk management system that integrated new risk calculations for various asset classes. The clearing house had set a tight deadline for the update because it impacted how they processed margin requirements for their traders.

During the final stages of testing, I encountered a critical issue in the production environment. Although everything had passed in staging, the production environment exposed a Kubernetes IAM configuration error that blocked part of the risk calculation service from accessing the necessary GCP resources. I realized that launching with this issue could cause significant disruptions to the clearing house’s processes. As a result, I had to delay the launch by a few days to correct the configuration and ensure a stable rollout.

I communicated the problem to the clearing house and explained that while we missed the initial deadline, this delay would prevent larger operational risks. To prevent this from happening again, I implemented more thorough production-like testing environments earlier in the pipeline, which helped us catch such issues before reaching the final stages of deployment.”

Dialog with an Analogy:

Interviewer: “How did you handle the delay when communicating with the internal clearing house?”

You: “I explained the delay using an analogy. It’s like when you’re getting ready for a big event, and just before leaving, you realize that you’re missing something critical, like your wallet. Sure, you could leave on time without it, but you’d run into bigger problems later. So, it’s better to stop, take a moment to fix the issue, and then proceed, ensuring everything runs smoothly. I wanted to avoid bigger operational problems down the line by fixing the configuration first.”
