At CME Group, I encountered a disagreement with a colleague while integrating a new market data API for our risk management system. The API was critical for real-time data ingestion to support equities products, and my colleague suggested a quick, direct approach to meet tight deadlines. He believed we could rely on manual testing to catch potential issues and expedite the process to stay on schedule. However, I disagreed because I felt this approach introduced too much risk. Our past experiences had shown that manual testing often missed edge cases, leading to costly post-launch fixes. I believed we needed automated testing to ensure the data was accurately ingested and processed before going live.

We resolved the disagreement by discussing the trade-offs in a team meeting. I explained the importance of early detection of data discrepancies and offered to lead the effort in setting up automated tests, which would validate the API and be reusable for future integrations. Ultimately, we reached a compromise: we implemented automated tests for the most critical aspects of the integration while still working to meet the tight deadline. This approach allowed us to ensure the quality of the integration without delaying the project, and the automated testing helped catch potential issues before they impacted production.

**Scenario with a Dev Team Member:**

**Dev**: "We disagree on the approach for this task."

**You**: "Itâ€™s like two people navigating a maze. We both see different routes, but if we talk it out, we can find the best path that leads us to the same goal."
