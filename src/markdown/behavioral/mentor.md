When mentoring new hires, I focus on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where they can quickly get up to speed and feel confident in their roles. I start by introducing them to the team and guiding them through the key systems and tools we use, breaking down complex concepts into digestible pieces to avoid overwhelming them.

One of the main things I emphasize is hands-on learning, so I often pair up with them on real tasks or projects, walking them through the codebase, best practices, and our development process. I also encourage them to ask questions and provide regular feedback on their progress to help them grow faster. For example, I mentored a new hire on our risk management platform by first walking them through the architecture, then gradually assigning them more responsibility in coding and testing, while always being available for support.

Additionally, I make it a point to check in regularly, not just on technical progress, but also to ensure they feel comfortable and integrated into the team culture. By creating an open line of communication, new hires are able to build confidence, take ownership of their work, and contribute meaningfully early on.

**Scenario with a Junior Developer:**

**Junior Dev**: "How do you approach mentoring?"

**You**: "I see mentoring like teaching someone to ride a bike. Iâ€™ll be there to guide and support until you find your balance, but ultimately, I want you to be able to ride on your own."
