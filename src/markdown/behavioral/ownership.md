At CME Group, I took full ownership of a project to migrate several core risk management services to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This project had tight deadlines and significant business impact, as these services were critical to daily operations. I led the initiative from start to finish, coordinating with cross-functional teams, managing the technical migration, and ensuring the new infrastructure was scalable and secure.

One of the challenges was ensuring zero downtime during the migration, as any disruptions could affect live trading. I implemented a phased migration plan with thorough testing at each stage, and I introduced automated testing to catch issues early in the process. I also communicated regularly with stakeholders to keep them informed of progress and any potential risks.

As a result, we successfully completed the migration on time with no downtime, improved system performance by 20%, and reduced production issues by 40%. The project was considered a major success, and it set a strong foundation for future cloud-based initiatives.

**Scenario with a Product Owner:**

**Product Owner**: "How do you approach taking ownership of tasks?"

**You**: "I see ownership like being the captain of a ship. You need to steer through both calm waters and storms, making decisions that keep the team moving forward, and ensuring we reach our destination."
