One time I went above and beyond was during the simultaneous launch of a new risk model and the migration of core services to Google Cloud at CME Group. We were working under tight deadlines, and the complexity of managing both projects simultaneously required extra effort to ensure success.

To make sure both initiatives were delivered on time, I took the lead in organizing cross-functional teams, setting up clear communication channels, and troubleshooting critical issues that arose during the migration. On top of my usual responsibilities, I also spent additional hours implementing automated testing frameworks to catch potential bugs early in the process, which wasn’t originally part of the project plan.

By going the extra mile to ensure quality and coordination, we not only met the deadline but also launched both the risk model and completed the migration with zero downtime. The extra effort I put into testing also reduced production bugs by 40%, making the overall project more successful than initially expected.

**Scenario with Manager:**

**Manager**: "I noticed you stayed late to finish the deployment. That wasn’t necessary."

**You**: "I felt like it was the right thing to do. It's like running an extra mile after a marathon—everyone did their part, but going a little further helps the team ensure everything's perfect."
