The last project I worked on was a significant initiative at CME Group, where we launched a new risk model while simultaneously migrating several core services to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This project was challenging due to its complexityâ€”ensuring the risk model functioned correctly while managing a cloud migration without disrupting critical operations required precise coordination.

One of the key obstacles we faced was the tight timeline, coupled with the need to ensure zero downtime during migration. There were also concerns about data consistency and system performance post-migration. To overcome these challenges, I played a key role in organizing cross-functional teams, implementing regular release meetings, and ensuring clear communication across all departments. I also contributed by leading the design and implementation of batch processing for high-volume data in GCP, which improved system throughput by 20%.

Additionally, I created thorough documentation on our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and architecture to keep everyone aligned and prepared for the migration. Thanks to these efforts, we not only launched the new risk model on time but also saw improved performance and scalability. The project was celebrated twice within the year, marking it as a key success.

**Scenario with a Manager:**

**Manager**: "How do you overcome obstacles at work?"

**You**: "I treat obstacles like a puzzle. They might seem complex at first, but by breaking them down into smaller parts and figuring out one piece at a time, you eventually solve the whole thing."
