At CME Group, I had to choose between two database solutions for a project that involved processing large volumes of real-time financial data. The first option was to use Postgres, which provided strong consistency, ACID transactions, and a familiar relational modelâ€”ideal for structured data and ensuring data integrity, especially in financial transactions. The second option was a combination of Cassandra for distributed, highly scalable storage and Redis for caching to enhance read performance. Cassandra offered the ability to handle large datasets with high availability, while Redis could provide fast, in-memory lookups for frequently accessed data. However, this setup introduced more complexity, especially with managing eventual consistency and multiple systems.

Before making the final decision, I ran both solutions in small sandbox environments to compare key metrics such as latency, throughput, and scalability under simulated workloads. After careful evaluation, I decided to go with the Cassandra and Redis combination. The scalability and high availability of Cassandra, along with the speed boost from Redis, made it the better fit for our real-time, high-throughput needs. This solution allowed us to handle growing data volumes efficiently while keeping latency low for frequently accessed data. In production, this architecture significantly improved system performance and ensured long-term scalability.

**Scenario with a Product Owner:**

**Product Owner**: "We have two solutions for optimizing the API, but which should we prioritize?"

**You**: "It's like choosing between two paths up a mountain. One is faster but has more risks, while the other is stable but slower. We can take the safer path to ensure stability first, then optimize later as we go."
