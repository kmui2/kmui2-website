Junior Dev: “I’ve been hearing about Redis and its caching abilities, but I’m not sure how to implement it efficiently. How do I handle eviction when the cache gets full?”

You: “Great question! One common strategy is to use Redis with an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy. LRU automatically removes the least recently accessed items when the cache reaches its memory limit, which helps keep the most frequently accessed data available.”

Junior Dev: “That sounds useful. How would I implement that?”

You: “Let’s go through it step-by-step. First, you need to configure Redis to use the LRU policy. In your Redis configuration file (redis.conf), you’ll set the eviction policy to LRU by adding or modifying this line:”

```bash
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

Junior Dev: “What does allkeys-lru mean?”

You: “Good question! It means that Redis will apply the LRU policy to all keys in the cache, regardless of whether they have expiration times set. So when Redis runs out of memory, it will start evicting the least recently used keys.”

Junior Dev: “Got it! What about setting a memory limit?”

You: “Yes, you need to specify the memory limit for your cache as well. You can set it like this in the redis.conf file:”

```bash
maxmemory 100mb
```

You: “This means Redis will start evicting the least recently used keys when the cache reaches 100 MB.”

Junior Dev: “That makes sense. How do I implement this in code?”

You: “Let’s implement a simple cache in Python using Redis with LRU. First, you need to install the Redis Python client if you haven’t already:”

Junior Dev: “So Redis will automatically remove the least recently used keys when the memory is full?”

You: “Exactly! In this example, if the cache exceeds 100 MB, Redis will start evicting the least recently accessed keys, like user:1001, if it’s one of the least used. You can also monitor the memory usage and evictions using Redis commands like INFO or MONITOR to ensure the LRU policy is working properly.”
