          As a seasoned Software Engineer with 8 years of senior level experience, specializing in
          fintech, Java backend, and React frontend development, I have a proven track record of
          designing and implementing high-volume risk management applications. During my tenure at
          CME Group for over 5 years, I honed my skills in developing cutting-edge solutions on
          Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and
          industry-specific knowledge that enables me to drive innovation and deliver exceptional
          results.
